# Charles Minard Graph
 This project is a modern reinterpretation of Charles Minard's famous graph depicting Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. Utilizing Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries—Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Altair—I recreated the historical graph with an emphasis on accuracy, visual appeal, and clarity.

**Project Overview**
The recreation of Charles Minard's graph was both a fun and challenging endeavor. It required creativity, a deep understanding of data manipulation, and an eye for design. This project not only aimed to replicate the visual representation of Napoleon's march but also to enhance it with updated data visualization techniques.

**Key Features**
Data Processing: Leveraged Pandas for cleaning and structuring the real historical data, including the dates and temperatures during the campaign.

Visualization Tools: Used a combination of Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting the geographical and temperature data, while Altair was employed for its interactive capabilities and elegant syntax.

Creative Challenge: Undertook the task of balancing historical accuracy with modern data visualization aesthetics, making the final product both informative and visually compelling.

**Dataset**
The dataset includes the historical temperatures, dates, and locations during Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It was meticulously compiled from various historical sources and processed to fit the needs of this project.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries matplotlib, seaborn ,pandas ,altair.
